<h1 font-size="50px" align="center">PDF Split using Python</h1>


## About


PDF splitter is used for split  the whole pdf into multiple pages using python, for this we can call this simple function or method for which I used package called PYPDF.

We have to Place the number of pdfs at one place and use the function (folder_pdf_spilter)  and mention the folder path then run the file there you got all pdfs into individual pdf pages.

This function takes in two arguments: file_path is the path to the PDF file that needs to be split, and pages is a list of tuples representing the page ranges to be extracted. Each tuple consists of two integers: the starting page number and the ending page number. For example, if pages is [(1, 3), (5, 6)], the function will create two output PDF files: "output_1-3.pdf" containing pages 1 to 3, and "output_5-6.pdf" containing pages 5 to 6.
